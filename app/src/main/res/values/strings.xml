        Most human activities cause pollution. It is because of the consumerist
        approach of us. We use more than our needs, which adversely affect nature. The gases from 
        vehicles and factories pollute the air. Solid garbage from factories, households, etc.
        pollutes the land and water. Agricultural wastes, pesticides cause pollution in the rural
        area. The massive sound of music, vehicle, and machinery causes noise pollution. The whole
        world is now suffering from pollution, which is causing Global Warming.Trees should be 
        planted on a large level to increase oxygen in the air. We should compromise with our
        consumerist approach. We have to understand the difference between need and want. Plastic
        bags should be avoided to decrease the level of land and water pollution. We should not
        always use our vehicle as more vehicle creates more harmful gases and noises. We should 
        maintain a proper drainage system to protect the water from getting polluted. Natural 
        activities can not be stopped, but we can control our actions. If we do so, we can minimize
        the impacts of pollution in nature.The pollutants that mix in the air directly affect living
        beings as they get into the body directly while breathing. Water pollutants are in the same
        way hazardous for living beings. In today’s time, manufacturing and construction units are
        significant sources of pollution. People living next to a manufacturing group often fall 
        ill either by noise or air pollution. But the irony is that humans are the ones who are
        deliberately polluting the environment. They’re just opening their own. We can’t get an
        utterly pollution-free world. Still, we can decrease the level of pollution around us by
        becoming more sensible and controlling our activities, causing pollution.Article on 
        Pollution: The process in which some toxic pollutants are added to our environment is called
        pollution. It makes the climate harmful for both all the living beings. Pollution mainly
        happens because of men made activities, whether done unknowingly or deliberately. Nowadays,
        it has become an important issue worldwide. Many countries are facing defective childbirths 
        and high mortality rates due to pollution. It makes natural things like water, air, soil,
